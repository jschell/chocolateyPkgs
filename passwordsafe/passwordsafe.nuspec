        <description>Password Safe allows you to manage your old passwords and to easily and quickly generate, store, organize, retrieve, and use complex new passwords, using password policies that you control. Once stored, your user names and passwords are just a few clicks away. 
Using Password Safe you can organize your passwords using your own customizable references - for example, by user ID, category, web site, or location. You can choose to store all your passwords in a single encrypted master password list (an encrypted password database), or use multiple databases to further organize your passwords (work and home, for example). And with its intuitive interface you will be up and running in minutes. 
What Makes Password Safe Secure?
So we claim to be secure. Why should you trust us? What steps do we take to back this claim? Well, here are a few: 
+Open Source - Most important, you don't have to take our word for it. You can download the source code and inspect it yourself, or have someone else check it for you. If you're really concerned, you can build the program from the sources you've downloaded and reviewed, instead of the binary files we build for each release.
+For the files we provide, you can check that they're the ones that we've uploaded, and not tampered with, by checking the GPG cryptographic signature that's generate for each file.
+Designed by Bruce Schneier - the original version was designed by renowned security expert Bruce Schneier, and we have his permission to say so.
+No back door / recovery mechanism - there's no way for users (or developers, for that matter) to access the passwords without the master key.
+Hard to brute-force - In the absence of back doors, an attacker can try a brute-force attack, e.g., using a dictionary. Password Safe has safeguards in place to make this as hard as possible.
+The master passphrase is never stored the clear. We store something that derived from the master passphrase, but hard to calculate. When you enter your passphrase, we duplicate the calculation and compare the results. Only if the comparison succeeds do we continue to derive the encryption key from your master passphrase.
+Sensitive memory is kept from swapping to disk.
+All user data is encrypted in memory.
+Memory with sensitive data is wiped as soon as possible.
+File integrity checks: Even if the file's encrypted, it's not necessarily prtoected against unauthorized modification. Password Safe implements integrity checks on the file so that an attacker cannot modify it without knowing the master passphrase.
+Reliability: Backups of previous databases are kept by default. The user can configure how many backups to keep and where to keep them.
+For more details, feel free to contact the authors.
